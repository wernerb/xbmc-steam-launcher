    <description lang="en">Launches Steam from within XBMC - It will close XBMC, launch Steam in Big Picture mode and when Steam is exited XBMC will restart. Steam also comes with a full featured web browser than can be controlled with a game pad or remote and plays back flash content. It works with Windows, Linux and quite possibly OSX, but this hasn't been tested.
